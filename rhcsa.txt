Example Exam 1:
1. Assuming the root user password is lost for C1 and your system is running in multiuser.target with no current root session open.
	boot your system into an appropriate target and chage the root user password to root1234
Solution:
		1] In the GRUB boot menu, press e on your current OS to modify its settings.
		2] Search the line which starts with "linux" and edit it deleting the words "quiet" and "rhgb", also append 			"init=/bin/sh" at the end of this same line.
		3] Press the combination "Ctrl+X" to reboot the system using the specified options.
		4] In the new shell, load the installed SELinux policies with the command "/usr/sbin/load_policy -i"
		5] Remount the filesystem in rw mode with "mount -o remount,rw /"
		6] Finally issue the "passwd root" command and modify the root password as you like.
		7] Remount the filesystem in read-only mode with "mount -o remount,ro /"
		8] Finally reboot your system with "exec /sbin/init 6"
		9] Login to the system with the new password.

2. Configure the primary network interface with hostname c1.home.local (alias rhcsa1)
	IP 192.168.0.121/24
	gtw 192.168.0.1/24
	dns 192.168.0.1/24
Solution:
	"ifconfig" or "ip a" to show which interface you need to modify
	vi to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-INTERFACENAME
	Edit the file according the following:
		BOOTPROTO=STATIC
		ONBOOT=YES
		IPADDR= 192.168.0.121
		NETMASK= 255.255.255.0
		GATEWAY= 192.168.0.1
	then systemctl restart network
	vi to /etc/resolv.conf
		nameserver 192.168.0.1
	to test it try to ping something with a name
	

3. Set default boot target to multiuser
4. set SELinux to enforcing mode
5. perform a case insensitive search for the pattern "then" in the /etc/prifile and save the result in the 
	/var/tmp/pattern.txt.
   Make sure that empty lines are not included
